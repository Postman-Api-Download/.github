## What is Postman API?

**Postman API** is a powerful and widely-used platform for API development, testing, and collaboration. It allows developers to design, mock, debug, and automate API workflows in a user-friendly environment. With support for REST, SOAP, and GraphQL, Postman simplifies every stage of the API lifecycle.

Whether you're building a new API or maintaining an existing one, Postman provides tools for:

- **Automated Testing** – Run tests automatically with every build.
- **Environment Management** – Configure variables for different stages.
- **Team Collaboration** – Share collections and workspaces effortlessly.
- **Documentation Generation** – Auto-generate and publish API docs.

Used by millions of developers worldwide, Postman is the go-to tool for ensuring API reliability and performance.
